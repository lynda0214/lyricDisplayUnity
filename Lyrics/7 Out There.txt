Out There, from Hunchback of Notre Dame/〈外面的世界〉，選自《鐘樓怪人》
Safe behind these windows and these parapets of stone/安全的待在被柵欄圍住的世界
Gazing at the people down below me/看著下方人來人往
All my life I watch them as I hide up here alone/總是躲在上面看著他們
Hungry for the histories they show me/渴望知道他們的故事
All my life I memorize their faces/記住了每張臉
Knowing them as they will never know me/認識他們，但他們卻不認識我
All my life I wonder how it feels to pass a day/我真好奇要是能夠有一天
Not above them/我能融入他們
But part of them/而不是遠遠的看著
And out there/若能在外面
Living in the sun/活在陽光下
Give me one day out there/多希望能有一天踏出去
All I ask is one/一天就夠了
To hold forever/我會永遠珍惜
Out there/若能在外面
Where they all live unaware/對自己的幸福毫無察覺
What I'd give/我會付出什麼呢？
What I'd dare/我要敢為此做什麼呢？
Just to live one day out there/就為了在外生活
